# Artifacts Calculator [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/f6c39a88-86ff-4614-87d8-3d4b3b143741/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/artifacts-calculator/deploys)

- https://artifacts-calculator.netlify.app

### Dev

- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

### Ideas for improvement

- Pick artifact from list instead of level and type
- Pick artifact and current level and automatically calculate the value of next upgrade (where do we find the artifact levels?)
- being able to compare two upgrades
